# P5-Communicate-Data-Findings
This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, you will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, you will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. The primary method of conveying your findings will be through transforming your exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.

## Datase:
------
> The data consists of information regarding 3.31 billion bike hiring, including age, timeframe, gender, station, and others. The dataset can be found in Ford GoBike website.
Dataset: (https://s3.amazonaws.com/fordgobike-data/index.html)
The data consisted of 16 different variables such as age, gender, weekday, time and others. It contains 3.31 billion rides. Ages in dataset from 18 to 56 takes 95% of the users in dataset. There were users more than 100 years old. So, we can remove users more than 60 years old as a cleaning and tidy up. Also, i generated new fields such as age group in order to make grouping and analyze the date by using groups.
Ford GoBike spreaded the service to San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose. However, it's hard to imagine traffic. So regarding this complexity, I decided to focus on San Fancisco area.


## Summary of the Findings:
-------
> Since the trip duration has a close relationship with bike share company's revenue, I tried to find out what are the key factors affect trip duration. It turns out that Weather does not have a big effect on the trip duration but user type does have an impact on trip duration. According the analysis, I found subscribers tend to rend the bikes for longer trips ( generally above 350 minutes ). One possible way to increase revenue is to attract more potential customers and convert more exiting customers to subscribers.
